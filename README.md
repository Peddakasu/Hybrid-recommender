# Hybrid-recommender
# ðŸ›’ Hybrid Recommender System

This is a **Streamlit app** that demonstrates a **Hybrid Product Recommender System** for e-commerce analytics.  
It combines **Popularity-based**, **Content-based**, and **Collaborative Filtering** approaches, and optionally clusters products using **K-Means**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **ðŸ”¥ Popular Products** â†’ ranked by distinct users/orders per product  
- **ðŸ“š Content-Based Filtering** â†’ TF-IDF on product name + category + description, cosine similarity  
- **ðŸ‘¥ Collaborative Filtering** â†’ itemâ€“item co-occurrence (implicit userâ€“item matrix)  
- **ðŸ”€ Hybrid Recommender** â†’ re-ranks by combining content & collaborative scores + popularity boost  
- **ðŸ§© K-Means Clustering** â†’ clusters products using text embeddings + price for exploration  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- The app automatically tries to load your dataset:
  - `Ecommerce_Delivery_Analytics_New.csv` (if present in repo or workspace)  
- If no dataset is found, it **falls back to a small built-in demo dataset** (so the app always runs).
